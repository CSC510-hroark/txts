I am a first-year graduate student in computer science at <font color=#ff00000>**NC state university**</font>. I enjoy programming in a variety of languages included Java, Python, C, and more. I have professional experience using these languages as well as web programming languages such as HTML and CSS.

Feel free to mail me at my [NCSU email](amthorn@ncsu.edu).


### Hobbies and interests ###

I'm interested in a variety of topics that mainly include science and mathematics. I love studying the natural sciences: Biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, etc... and I enjoy involving myself in academic pursuits such as tutoring and teaching.

# Project Proposal - Inspiration

We are a team of Computer Science graduates at North Carolina State University who aim to develop a Battery Management Application for logging device battery information and uploading this data on to a shared space for developer analysis.
We have been inspired by Google's **Project Volta** for our Project proposal.

*More information about Project Volta from Google developer summit can be found in this short video :*

# Why is Battery Important?

### Critical Resource:
- Limited and necessary resource for a device to function.
- A good battery life is a direct attribute towards a better User/Consumer experience.

### Options to enhance Battery Life :
- Extended batteries.
- Solar chargers.
- Case Batteries.
- Trontium reactors.


# Consumption Facts
-A chart to show the consumption facts of a typical smart device.

# Project Statement
We aim to develop a tool to analyze the device battery of smartphones and provide a means for developers to analyze the report stats for developing battery efficient applications.


# Our Approach

### Route One:
- Android Studio
- Gradle build tool
- AVD for emulation.
- SQLite database.

### Route Two:
- LAMP/WAMP architectures.
- Postgres/MySql for databases.


# Route One

## ART(Android Run Time) + Android Studio

### Pros :
- A comprehensive IntelliJ IDE which provides code refactoring and debug tools.
- Learning curve is one to two weeks given our team mates know Java.
- Easy installation and configuration of Studio tools.
- Android developer support forums for documentation.

### Cons :
- All of us are new to System level API's in Android.
- No prior experience to most of our team mates in Android development.
- Less explored area of development-> Little to no proper documentation in terms of help resources.
- Development activity susceptible to errors which might be difficult to resolve given less documentation.

# Route Two

## LAMP/WAMP Architecture

### Pros :
- Open source
- Proven, Stable and flexible stack for application development.
- Widely deployed and suited for development of System tools and applications which run on low cost hardware.

### Cons :
- Less documentation with regard to our Project.
- Development activity would be an iterative process and subject to errors and mistakes.
- Time constraints in achieving the project end result would mean a lot of pressure to deliver a stable functioning application.

# GnuPlot Magic

As shown here:

<img align=right src="../img/plot/new.png">

- z-ness has large variance [@item1; @item2].
- x is symmetric to y  [@item3, pp. 33-35]
- as predicted by theory [@item1]


# DOT Exmaple

This is how we roll

rolling ![all the dat](../img/dot/dot1.png)

# Conclusion

### Example Equation
- $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$

### Another Example Equation
- $(a+b)^3=a^3 + b^3 + 3(ab)(a+b)$
